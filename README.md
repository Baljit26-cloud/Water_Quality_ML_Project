💧 Water Quality Potability Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

🎯 Project Goal
To develop a robust and fast-acting Machine Learning model capable of classifying water samples as either Potable (Safe for drinking) or Not Potable (Unsafe) based on nine key chemical parameters.

This project demonstrates the application of supervised classification techniques (Random Forest) coupled with advanced data cleaning and feature selection, achieving maximum performance on the provided dataset.

🛠️ Project Methodology (The Engineering Decisions)
The final model achieves a stable accuracy of 70.43% after addressing critical data quality issues that limited performance.
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  .Missing Values: Values in pH, Sulfate, and Trihalomethanes were filled using the column's mean (Mean Imputation). This        maintains dataset size and distribution integrity.
  .Outlier Removal: Extreme outlier readings (top 1% and bottom 1%) from the critical columns (pH and Sulfate) were removed      using the Percentile Method. This was crucial for stabilizing the model and improving accuracy.

2. Feature Selection
Instead of using all nine parameters, the final model was trained only on the most predictive features, as determined by Feature Importance analysis
 .Selected Features: The Top 5 features used are Sulfate, pH, Hardness, Chloramines, and Solids. These features demonstrated    the highest predictive cumulative importance score.
3. Model Selection and Tuning
The Random Forest Classifier was selected due to its robustness against complex data patterns and its high reliability in classification tasks.
 .Tuning Parameter (class_weight="balanced"): The dataset had an imbalance (more safe water samples than unsafe). This          parameter was added to ensure the model paid equal attention to the smaller class (Unsafe water), preventing bias and         improving real-world predictive utility.

  .Final Estimators: n_estimators=1000 was used to ensure the model benefited from a large committee of decision trees,          minimizing individual tree errors.

🚀 Final Results and Deployment
